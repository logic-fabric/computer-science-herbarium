# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code:

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

## Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignement of responsibilities between objects:

- Chain of Responibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
